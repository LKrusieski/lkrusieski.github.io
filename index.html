      <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Computer Science student with an interdisciplinary foundation rooted in Mechanical Engineering Technology.
        I enjoy building practical systems that bridge software and the physical world where constraints like hardware interfaces,
        reliability, and real-world workflows matter as much as clean code.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interests center on embedded electronics, distributed systems, IoT, and UAS, with a focus on designing software that is
        maintainable, secure, and scalable. I’m especially motivated by projects that translate technical requirements into working
        features and that improve the usability and traceability of real operations (e.g., inventory and logistics workflows).

        This recorded code review provides a technical walkthrough of my mobile inventory
        application developed for CS-360. In the review, I discuss design decisions,
        application structure, data handling, and areas for improvement, demonstrating
        my ability to communicate technical concepts clearly and critically evaluate my work.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The work that I have done for CS-499 developing my ePortfolio has been instrumental in clarifying my professional goals, 
        strengthening my technical competencies, and preparing me to enter the field as a more capable and employable software developer. 
        Throughout the overall SNHU computer science program, the coursework emphasized both theoretical foundations and applied development, 
        allowing me to grow not only as a programmer, but as a problem solver who understands how software systems are designed, built, secured, 
        and communicated to diverse stakeholders. These skills will have to be developed further, as ongoing learning is critical for any professional, 
        but the skills I have learned form a strong foundation for my future career.
        
        Team collaboration was touched upon in nearly every course, although there were less opportunities to work in a team that would have been 
        afforded by an in-person program. Despite this, my work both in the computer science program and in my life thus far has prepared me to work 
        as a member of an interdisciplinary team effectively and in adverse circumstances with teammates. Equally important was learning to communicate 
        with stakeholders who may not share a technical background. Across multiple assignments, I was required to explain design decisions, trade-offs, 
        and risks in clear, accessible language. This skill became especially important when documenting system architecture, database schemas, and 
        security models. Being able to translate technical complexity into meaningful explanations strengthened my ability to advocate for sound design 
        decisions while remaining responsive to user and business needs.
        
        My foundation in data structures and algorithms underpins my technical work in both this course and the other courses that I have completed. 
        Coursework reinforced how choosing appropriate data structures directly affects performance, scalability, and maintainability. Through hands-on 
        development, I applied arrays, lists, maps, trees, and sorting algorithms such as merge sort and binary search to efficiently manage and retrieve 
        data. These concepts were not treated as abstract theory; instead, they were integrated into real applications where algorithmic efficiency and 
        data organization directly impacted usability and responsiveness.
        
        My skills in software engineering and database design matured significantly over the course of the program. I gained experience designing modular, 
        object-oriented applications with clear separation of concerns, reusable components, and well-defined interfaces. Database concepts evolved from 
        local persistence solutions to broader discussions of schema design, normalization, data integrity, and migration strategies. Exposure to both 
        relational and NoSQL paradigms strengthened my ability to select appropriate storage technologies based on system requirements rather than familiarity alone.
